Hi Ashish

I hope this email finds you well. We appreciate your interest in Entrata India and would like to proceed with the next step in our hiring process – Coding Test.

Coding Challenge: Entrata.com Selenium Tests

Goal:

Write 3-5 Selenium tests to explore and validate the functionality of entrata.com.

Instructions:

 
Setup:

 
Set up a new Selenium project in either Java or Python.

 
Use the Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.

 
Choose one of the following frameworks:

 
 
(Java) JUnit or TestNG with Maven as a dependency manager

 
(Python) Pytest

 
 
Test Cases:

 
Write 3-5 tests that cover a range of functionalities.

 
Your tests could include scenarios such as navigating through different pages, interacting with forms (without submitting them), verifying dynamic content, or any other interesting feature.

 
Assertions:

 
 
Use appropriate assertions to validate the expected outcomes in each test case.

 
For example, use assertions from the chosen testing framework (e.g., assertEquals, assertTrue, etc.).

 
Documentation:

 
Provide clear comments to explain the purpose of each test case and any important steps.

 
Include a README file with instructions on how to run the tests.

 
Note:

 
Avoid Form Submissions:

 
Please refrain from submitting any forms on the live entrata.com site during the testing process. Focus on interacting with the forms programmatically without triggering actual submissions.

Submission:

 
Share the code via a public GitHub repository.

Provide a link to the GitHub repository in your submission.

 
Evaluation Criteria:

 
Correctness: Ensure that the tests accurately verify the specified functionalities.

 
Readability: Write clean and well-documented code.

 
Completeness: Cover a diverse set of test scenarios that showcase different aspects of the website.

 
Use appropriate waits: Implement explicit waits to handle dynamic elements or asynchronous behavior.

 
Additional Tips:

Familiarize yourself with the structure and behavior of entrata.com before writing the tests.

Good luck! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

.

*IMPORTANT: We will execute one of the following commands on your code submission and expect the tests to run:

 
(Java)  ‘mvn verify’

(Python) ‘pytest’
